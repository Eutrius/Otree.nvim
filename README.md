  show_ignore = false,
  cursorline = true,

  ignore_patterns = {},

  keymaps = {
    ["<CR>"] = "actions.on_enter",
    ["l"] = "actions.on_enter",
    ["h"] = "actions.on_close_dir",
    ["q"] = "actions.close_win",
    ["<C-h>"] = "actions.goto_parent",
    ["<C-l>"] = "actions.goto_dir",
    ["<M-H>"] = "actions.goto_pwd",

    ["H"] = "actions.close_dirs",
    ["o"] = "actions.edit_dir",
    ["st"] = "actions.open_tab",
    ["sv"] = "actions.open_vsplit",
    ["ss"] = "actions.open_split",
    ["s."] = "actions.toggle_hidden",
    ["si"] = "actions.toggle_ignore",
    ["r"] = "actions.refresh",
    ["sf"] = "actions.focus_file",
  },

  tree = {
    connector_last = "‚îî‚îÄ",
    connector_middle = "‚îú‚îÄ",
    vertical_line = "‚îÇ",
    spacing = "  ",

## üß™ User Commands

| Command       | Description                 |

## üîß Netrw Hijack

When `hijack_netrw = true`, **Otree** automatically launches:

- When Neovim is opened without a specific file
- When opened in a directory (`nvim .`, `nvim ..`, etc.)
- As a full replacement for Netrw

---

## üõ† Oil.nvim Integration

**Otree** utilizes `oil.nvim` for file operations. When both plugins are installed, a compatible default configuration for `oil.nvim` is applied automatically:

```lua
require("oil").setup({
  use_default_keymaps = false,
  skip_confirm_for_simple_edits = true,
  delete_to_trash = true,
  cleanup_delay_ms = 100,
  default_file_explorer = false,
  keymaps = {
    ["st"] = { "actions.toggle_trash", mode = "n" },
  },
  confirmation = {
    max_width = 0.9,
    min_width = { 30 },
  },
})
```

---

## üß∞ Troubleshooting

- **Missing icons?**
  Ensure `nvim-web-devicons` is installed and properly configured.

- **Tree doesn't open on startup?**
  Set `open_on_startup = true` in your setup.

- **Tree not showing for directories?**
  Enable `hijack_netrw = true`.

- **Command not found: `fd`?**
  Install [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) or its Debian/Ubuntu alias `fdfind`, and ensure it's in your system `$PATH`.
